Nowadays, social media is playing an important role in people’s lives. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are only some of the social media products. By using those applications, people have the chance to share their personal data every day. The content of the posts can come in a large variety. People can share any information that they want to share such as their personal lives, relational statuses, their emotional states and even their political views. However, too much information becomes irritating for people who are using social media, especially some posts and contents that include violence.

Too much data has always been a problem for designers and end users. On designer’s perspective, designers try not to show so many shared posts. Those posts could be a reason for capacity and performance issues. On the other hand, on the customer perspective, users get bothered to see posts that have violence, vandalism, bad words, un-motivational posts and these can affect people’s physical condition. Designers came up with a solution to solve this problem with feed filtering. Many social media tools use algorithms to show posts in their feeds according to their content, people who shared these contents (close friends) and emotions in the posts. However, deciding a correct algorithm to show shared posts with the wanted content is still a problematic issue. Facebook filters messages in Newsfeeds, because it is not possible or practical to show all updates. And according to researchers, Facebook uses an algorithm to classify posts to emotionally positive or negative content.

In my opinion, I found this algorithm to show the content of the shared posts is helpful for people who are using Facebook. People are using Facebook to gather information on a daily basis, to know other people’s lives, and to spend some fun time. This is the key point of the social media. Hence, classifying the content of the posts help people to see more motivational content. Of course, that doesn’t mean always show funny kitty videos. Facebook also gives a chance to people to customize their Facebook feeds. In that manner, people have the chance to see posts in their feeds on a specific content. Facebook also suggests a content that you like during your usage. With the help of this working principle, I find this approach plausible.

With the changing technology, there are so many ways to gather information about the emotional states of people. Social media, smart phones, and smart watches are some of the highlights of the today’s technology. The applications such as “beat stress” can monitor a user’s emotional state. Smart watches are the new way of collecting information from users. By analyzing the person’s location, weather, environmental noise level, e-mails and phone calls can make a statistical data for the person’s emotional state. This is the best development for the people who have stress in their lives. This product can be improved towards getting insights on the emotional level of users, and according to their level of emotion, providing a solution with content, giving motivational examples and words and even blocking calls and emails for a while.

Emotion sensing is another smartphone application for mood tracking. People have a chance to log their emotional state on a daily and weekly basis. Using smartphones’ accelerometers and GPS creates a pattern on how much time is spent in areas and what are the emotional states of people during this period. I had a chance to use this application for a month. I believe, this could be integrated with the social media and calendar of the smartphone.

To sum up, manipulating peoples’ emotional states in a motivational way is helpful for the future. With the changing technology, the content of the posts and classifying the true content will be enhanced.
